# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

se_project_aroundtheus is our first project in dealing with responsive web pages at different resolutions. The project is meant to help us learn and create a responsive webpage that will act correctly at different screen resolutions. Through Figma, we find all of the specifications we need in order to code into VScode. Through the integrated terminal, the project is to be uploaded to github for review. Display grid is one of the main focuses of this project.
